    <p>The IT professional we interviewed is Jarrod Barwick. Jarrod is the IT coordinator for the North West Metro region of Victoria Police, Jarrod has been in this current position with Victoria Police for 3 years. While Jarrod is an IT professional and has a vast spread of experience across multiple facets of IT such as dealing with hardware vendors and ordering and managing hardware and tech supply, troubleshooting and tech support, database administration and setup and dealing with high profile clients while managing various projects, Jarrod’s current role is more managerial and he oversees the north-west metro region of Melbourne Victoria Police’s internal IT department, this means that Jarrod’s current role is more engaged in ensuring his department achieves and meets key deadlines and performance indicators as well as ensuring IT projects commissioned by members of Victoria Police to aid in police investigations and to supplement police work are meeting their specifications and fulfilling their requirements.
    </p>

   <p>Due to Jarrod’s internal IT department being insular and being a government position, Jarrod has no interaction with external stakeholders such as clients or the general public. Jarrod instead works and interacts with other IT professionals working under him as well as sworn members of Victoria Police ranging from senior constables to assistant commissioners to coordinate IT projects. Jarrod operates primarily from his office in the CBD at the police headquarters, but due to COVID has recently been working from home more frequently which due to the managerial nature of his position makes it simple to work remotely. Although when a project requires a mobile IT setup such as a large event that requires police oversight i.e sporting match at the MCG can at times require on site supervision, this can either be performed by Jarrod in person or one of Jarrod’s offsiders.Jarrod also regularly attends police stations that fall under his purview within the north-west metro region. These regular station visits can serve a number of purposes, whether that may be for hardware upgrades, resolving on site software or hardware issues, integration of completed projects, such as a newly created aliasing system to help investigate in cell groups on social media.
    </p>
   <p>Jarrod specified that he did not find the technical aspects of his job difficult. Jarrod holds a Certificate IV in Information Technology and a Diploma in Networking and said that while he was not the most technically skilled IT professional he would pick most things up as he worked on the job. Jarrod identified the most difficult aspect of his job as promoting productivity and offering encouragement to staff to work as efficiently as possible. Jarrod stated that he used to work for Hewlett Packard and in a management position there he had the ability to use deadlines and agreements which stipulated financial reparations in the case of uncompleted or late work as methods to ensure employee productivity and meeting the expected standard of work “one way that I would often be able to motivate people is we would have service level agreements. If this isn't done, we will have to pay potentially millions of dollars in penalties for not having that work performed”. Due to Victoria Police being a government organisation they do not have the pressure of outside organisations using contractual agreements and monetary pressure as a means of holding employees accountable and this presents a challenge to IT managers as they need to ensure their teams are working to a given standard. Jarrod says that losing that kind of leverage actually makes it quite a bit more challenging to encourage his teams to be as invested in their work.
