<!-- IDEAL JOBS COMPARISON -->
<h3 style="font-size:30px"><strong><u>Ideal Jobs Comparison</u></strong></h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">The ideal jobs chosen by the 6 team members have some common elements among them. All these 6 positions require tertiary or above educational qualifications. Most preferably a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology or similar. Moreover, applicants are required to adhere to company standards as well as to ensure a smooth workflow while working alongside with other staff and customers. In addition to this, most of these organisations expect their potential candidates to possess excellent verbal and written communication skills as well as the ability to work under pressure with minimum supervision as key features to perform well.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Team members have chosen job roles which are related to different industries. For instance, Hayden and Chalani both chose two IT jobs which are interrelated since both of them consist in providing technical support to medical informatic devices. In this case, we are talking about working in the HealthCare and Biomedical industries. Most importantly, these IT positions consist of working and spending most of the time alongside medical professionals and experts. On the other hand, Samantha’s selection as her ideal job is the Lighting Supervisor position. This type of role requires a vast knowledge on how to use IT technologies and software to obtain quality and high standard lighting systems for different types of events. Furthermore, Liam’s choice for his ideal job is Software Developer. Software developers' roles differentiates from others due to the fact that it consists in designing, developing, coding and testing of softwares. As a matter of fact, software developers are expected to be working using different types of programming languages to deliver quality software products. In addition, Matthew has chosen the role of a Data Analyst as his ideal job. The role of Data analyst helps organisations and its clients by collecting, interpreting and structuring data sets using SQL, PivotTable and Excel. Technical skills required for this type of job position are in-depth knowledge of programming languages, statistics, maths and database query tools. Finally, Alexander’s ideal job is System Administrator for an E-commerce organisation. The role of System Administrator is tasked with maintaining and troubleshooting any IT related issues and to provide efficient solutions to those issues in a timely manner.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Career plans across the group are very similar due to the fact that each member has chosen a career which has a strong connection to the Information Technology stream. IT is a field which is rapidly evolving which helps the society’s betterment. As a result, all team members are willing to learn and improve their knowledge in Information Technology by undertaking a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology and they look forward to completing other IT related certifications to stay up to date due to its fast evolving nature. The noted differences among team members' careers are mainly due to various sub-streams. For instance, Hayden’s and Chalani’s ideal jobs are connected to the Healthcare industry while Samantha’s choice falls into the animation, film and entertainment field. Liam's chosen field is software engineering, whereas Matthew’s ideal job is mainly related to industries like business and finance. Also, Alexander has chosen the system administration pathway.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">However, in-depth knowledge in computer science and Information Technology remains as the most important requirement for all these roles.</p>
