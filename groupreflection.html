<!-- CHALANI REFLECTION -->
<ul><li>
<h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Chalani</em></strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px">Participating in a group project means collaborating with team members who have different types of personalities as well as different types of ideas and opinions. The ability to find a good balance within the group is the key to successfully achieving project goals. During the project, things that went well are early planning, task allocation as appropriate and helping team members when they are struggling. Identified improvements that we should consider in the future are: better communication among team members, ability to meet soft deadlines as well as the ability to be a little bit more committed in timely handing over allocated project sections. One thing that was surprising while working as a group is how working together with other team members helped to gain more knowledge in various aspects of IT. One thing that I have learned about groups is that if everyone in the team equally contributes, it can help us to achieve better outcomes/results. Also, the GitHub activity log helped us to keep a track of the progress of each member. One surprising thing that I have observed in each team member are as follows: Liam always has a positive attitude, Matthew always helps anyone in need, Hayden’s effort to deliver quality project work, Alexander’s ability to provide regular updates on time and finally Samantha’s energy and motivation she showed up throughout the whole project. All these helped me to gain a good knowledge and improve my skills in a team environment.

<!-- SAMANTHA REFLECTION -->
<ul><li>
<h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Samantha</em></strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px"> After completing this group project, it was very enlightening to collaborate with team members with different work ethics. Organisation is something that was key to completion. As everyone has different schedules, it was hard to hold our meeting with all members attending and I only remember one meeting doing so. This is expected when it comes to team projects, however, I do believe that as a team we did and can work more on, is regular communication. When we were able to communicate - even though we did so in the final moments of submission, we were able to achieve the goals we set out. By giving each other regular updates and goals such as theory work to all be done by a certain date, gave an expectation and somewhat pressure to keep our word and to follow through. We should be doing this more throughout the completion of Assignment 3. Things that I observed from each members; Chalani was a great support and leader when dealing with deadlines, Alex achieved said goals and maintained expectations throughout, Hayden, although sometimes procrastinating, always finalised his parts, especially a big help with the html portions, Liam provided a can-do attitude and regular updates, Matthew was also a good help with the html.
</p>

<!-- HAYDEN REFLECTION -->
<ul><li>
<h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Hayden</em></strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px">Towards the end of this group project, I can say that this group has performed well in this assignment. While we had a rough start, communication was the key to completing this project and i was exceptionally impressed with the ability of my group to negotiate and create meeting times despite their busy schedules. While not everyone could participate in the meetings, their efforts to communicate their progress and update others who had missed out on the meetings was one of the reasons we were able to stay on track and understand which parts needed to be finished. With that said, some key points that we could improve on is, our ability to communicate and be more organised within the group, our lack of organisation was one of the main reasons we were running behind on schedule and required alot more extra effort to try pull everyone together to plan out the assignment. This group project has taught me that communication with a large group is extremely important and that constant updates will ultimately lead into success and that working together in a group is a whole different dynamic compared to doing an individual assignment because not only do you have to understand your parts but you need to also understand the other group members as well. Upon observation of my team members: Chalani had demonstrated great leadership skills with her constant communication and ability to stay on track with the assignment, Liam’s funny personality and attitude always made assignment work more interesting, Alexander’s innate ability to not procrastinate and keep his promises by finalising his assignment part without fail, Matthew’s special ability to construct excel spreadsheets for group contribution and his enthuasiam towards the assignment and last but not least Samantha, who had amazing energy and was able to keep the group on track during our meetings.

<!-- ALEXANDER REFLECTION -->
<ul><li>
<h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Alexander</em></strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px">I feel the communication was quite good, we would regularly touch base – if anyone couldn’t attend a meeting, there was an explanation behind it most of the time. When it wasn’t a scheduled meeting however, the method or platform of communication could have been better – although I understood why we should use teams, it wasn’t exactly great with notifications however I’m unsure if this was an isolated issue. I was more surprised nothing had went wrong, I’ve been part of groups where I had to mediate between conflicting group members, a lot of my previous groups had been pulled in the middle of plagiarism although my section was all clear so I often had to attend mediation even though I was not part of the affected members – so its been quite rare for me to be part of a group that has actually ran as smoothly as this one has despite running behind schedule. A thing I had learnt throughout working with this group on the assignment, is how much touching base and soft deadlines are important to the end result. The soft deadlines which unofficially were our meetings on teams – had helped keep everyone accountable for themselves, the updates kept everyone on track and If any help was requested or deemed necessary – we had all put in our part to help any struggling section.</p>
</li></ul>

<!-- MATTHEW REFLECTION -->
<ul><li>
<h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Matthew</em></strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px"> I missed the first week of this project due to COVID, and I was worried that with six people effective communication would be difficult. However, when our group got the ball rolling, we really got in the groove. We allocated different parts of the project to each person, and had calls at least twice a week to make sure everyone was on track. Often people would ask others for help, like staying back after a meeting with questions about GitHub. Although not everyone could attend every meeting, the plan that we had laid out meant that everyone could stay on track. I was really impressed that, even with a delayed start, our group managed to catch up and complete everything by the deadline. We also let people play to their strengths when allocating work, which meant that everyone could feel like they got a good deal. Hayden was a massive help with plenty of knowledge about things like HTML and Liam was the one who’s idea we expanded on, and who organised the interview. Chalani was great at following up and making sure people were at where they needed to be, Alex had an ability to work consistently where the rest of us would struggle, and Samantha was always upbeat in our meetings, with motivation that was probably infectious. Everyone in the group played their part really well, and all worked hard so that we could achieve this goal.

<br></br>

<!-- TEAM REFLECTION -->
<h4 style="font-size:30px"><strong> Team Group Reflection</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px"> The group had a little bit of a rough start, starting a bit behind time as shown by the date of our first meeting – but with regular meetings and soft deadlines, we managed to meet them despite minor road bumps in the way. We all had touched base through our regular meetings and communication platforms, we all had each other for support with either struggling sections or general questions – and touching base with progress updates allowed us to keep ourselves accountable. Once we had found our groove with the start and regular updates throughout – the group agreed we moved forward with a strong start.</p>
<br>
<p>We all agreed that communication and delegation of tasks were our strong points throughout Assignment 2, as well as how our personalities had matched in a way to make the assignment work for us. When there were members who were unable to attend meetings, they had caught up through either the recorded meeting or through a team member summarising the meeting through our communication platforms</p>
<br>
<p>We agreed that soft deadlines were a point of improvement, there were team members who didn’t always meet the deadlines putting us behind where we would have liked to be, and as well as this – not submitting already complete sections which were previously completed on the agreed draft or final copy of the assignment – but the members had always caught up and submitted accordingly. In saying soft deadlines were a point of improvement, this is one point we did also learn while working with the group as well as the importance of constant updates – which we will bring forward into assignment 3.</p>
<p>A surprising thing that was agreed upon for each team member, was how supportive Chelani was towards the rest of the group as well as her ability to lead the group flawlessly with impeccable communication – making sure everyone remembered their part and keeping everyone on track, Samanthas motivation and energy throughout the assignment – also playing her part in helping keep everyone on track, Haydens ability to meet the soft deadlines swiftly with quality – and great help with assisting in the framework and styling with CSS and HTML, Liams positive can-do attitude with regular updates along with Matthew and his HTML and Spreadsheet contributions as seen in </p>
<br>
<p>Appendix A – which helped provide markers for how far along we had progressed in the assignment, and Alexanders ability to provide timely updates and finish his work according to soft deadlines without fail. Only one member was surprised in general nothing had gone wrong, however the member acknowledges this was a fairly subjective experience due to the individuals prior experiences with previous groups.</p>
