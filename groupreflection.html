<p style="font-size:18px">Participating in a group project means collaborating with team members who have different types of personalities as well as different types of ideas and opinions. The ability to find a good balance within the group is the key to successfully achieving project goals. During the project, things that went well are early planning, task allocation as appropriate and helping team members when they are struggling. Identified improvements that we should consider in the future are: better communication among team members, ability to meet soft deadlines as well as the ability to be a little bit more committed in timely handing over allocated project sections. One thing that was surprising while working as a group is how working together with other team members helped to gain more knowledge in various aspects of IT. One thing that I have learned about groups is that if everyone in the team equally contributes, it can help us to achieve better outcomes/results. Also, the GitHub activity log helped us to keep a track of the progress of each member. One surprising thing that I have observed in each team member are as follows: Liam always has a positive attitude, Matthew always helps anyone in need, Hayden’s effort to deliver quality project work, Alexander’s ability to provide regular updates on time and finally Samantha’s energy and motivation she showed up throughout the whole project. All these helped me to gain a good knowledge and improve my skills in a team environment.

<h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Hayden</em></strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px">Towards the end of this group project, I can say that this group has performed well in this assignment. While we had a rough start, communication was the key to completing this project and i was exceptionally impressed with the ability of my group to negotiate and create meeting times despite their busy schedules. While not everyone could participate in the meetings, their efforts to communicate their progress and update others who had missed out on the meetings was one of the reasons we were able to stay on track and understand which parts needed to be finished. With that said, some key points that we could improve on is, our ability to communicate and be more organised within the group, our lack of organisation was one of the main reasons we were running behind on schedule and required alot more extra effort to try pull everyone together to plan out the assignment. This group project has taught me that communication with a large group is extremely important and that constant updates will ultimately lead into success and that working together in a group is a whole different dynamic compared to doing an individual assignment because not only do you have to understand your parts but you need to also understand the other group members as well. Upon observation of my team members: Chalani had demonstrated great leadership skills with her constant communication and ability to stay on track with the assignment, Liam’s funny personality and attitude always made assignment work more interesting, Alexander’s innate ability to not procrastinate and keep his promises by finalising his assignment part without fail, Matthew’s special ability to construct excel spreadsheets for group contribution and his enthuasiam towards the assignment and last but not least Samantha, who had amazing energy and was able to keep the group on track during our meetings.

<!-- ALEXANDER REFLECTION -->

<h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Alexander</em></strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px">I feel the communication was quite good, we would regularly touch base – if anyone couldn’t attend a meeting, there was an explanation behind it most of the time. When it wasn’t a scheduled meeting however, the method or platform of communication could have been better – although I understood why we should use teams, it wasn’t exactly great with notifications however I’m unsure if this was an isolated issue. I was more surprised nothing had went wrong, I’ve been part of groups where I had to mediate between conflicting group members, a lot of my previous groups had been pulled in the middle of plagiarism although my section was all clear so I often had to attend mediation even though I was not part of the affected members – so its been quite rare for me to be part of a group that has actually ran as smoothly as this one has despite running behind schedule. A thing I had learnt throughout working with this group on the assignment, is how much touching base and soft deadlines are important to the end result. The soft deadlines which unofficially were our meetings on teams – had helped keep everyone accountable for themselves, the updates kept everyone on track and If any help was requested or deemed necessary – we had all put in our part to help any struggling section.</p>
