<p style="font-size:18px">Working with team members of THURS Group #25 has been very interesting and enjoyable. In fact, collaborating with team members who have various cultural backgrounds, personalities, ideas and skills has been very useful to successfully achieve Assignment 3 goals. As a group, we have been able to improve many aspects of teamwork compared to the previous Assignment 2. As a matter of fact, we have been able to early plan all the meetings ahead, created an excel sheet to keep a track of the progress of each team member's assigned work, and above all we have been able to respect all the soft deadlines. Although we were able to improve our capabilities of teamwork over the course of the group assignments, if there is anything that we could get further improved, that would be our team coordination skills. One thing that I have learned while working in a group is that planning ahead and everyone’s equal contribution to the project will lead us to complete and deliver a quality project on time with peace of mind. One surprising thing that I have noticed in each team member are as follows: Samantha’s ability to efficiently lead weekly group meetings on Teams, Liam’s impeccable attention to detail, Alexander’s knowledge in Information Technology field, Matthew’s ability to create extraordinary excel spreadsheets to track the progress and interface designing and last but not least Hayden’s energy and the capability to style and make attractive HTML pages. Overall, as a team we are happy about our team and the deliveries.

<p style="font-size:18px">The process of completing Assignment 3 was a big improvement from the previous assignment in terms of organisation, communication and team effort. Before starting this assignment, we had a team meeting that went through all the emotions and feelings we had about assignment 2 and how we should improve. A big factor that was talked about was organisation, we decided early on to split up the work and set hard deadlines for people to follow in order to ensure that all report sections were completed and present in time for submission. During this meeting, we also talked about our faults, one was communication that could be improved on, which I believe this time round was a lot better as we all took this assignment seriously as individuals as well as a team. Matthew was determined and took a leadership-like role by setting meeting times, communicating regularly on our collective whatsapp group chat which is a big improvement from Assignment 2, he also took the responsibility of figma after a miscommunication within the group. Hayden completed his work on time and helped a lot with the technical side (html and figma) and an overall good team member. Alex finished his work early and attended meetings frequently. Chalani communicated efficiently and completed her work on time as well, she was great at reminding members of specifics concerning the rubric and the specifications. Liam completed his work effectively and took a primary role in html.

<h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Alexander</em></strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px"> Assignment 3 definitely had a stronger start for us. We continued discussions within days and got right back to work, balancing any other existing priorities. We had definitely improved on communication, notably having all members of our group present during every meeting – as well as present during Consultation with Anthony. We had gotten better with showing progress on our central document to show how we were progressing along with the assignment. As for points of improvement to be made for future group assignments, having slightly better communication – more in terms of content updates, perhaps having some form of progress by the time each group meeting had happened (unless explained for prior) although for the most part – we had improved on it quite a lot and got better with asking for help. An aspect which surprised me with each team member – Matthew had kept ontop of his work consistently throughout, without slipping up as he did in A2 – and more often actually took part in coordinating meeting times, Chalani had consistently kept in regular communication with all of us and reminding us of rubric requirements, Liam’s attention to detail on the project with html and the idea – keeping us informed with his original vision for the project so that the group could help make it into something more, Samantha had upkept her energy to lead group meetings as effectively as A2 and Hayden’s attention to detail with HTML as well as the Figma prototype. Throughout working on this assignment, it has only further backed how important communication was throughout the whole assignment – even if it is was only minor updates.

<!-- TEAM REFLECTION -->
<h4 style="font-size:30px"><strong> Team Group Reflection</strong></h4>

<p style="font-size:18px">Throughout Assignment 3, we all agreed that there had been drastic improvements made since Assignment 2. We all had organised ourselves better, had set our deadlines very early on in order to ensure that our report portion of the assignment was completed to the best of our ability. We all had upkept our communication – more notably having more members in frequently, and having our meetings more frequently. We were all more than willing to contribute our part, volunteer to help out other sections where possible – and more importantly, hear each other out in order to help shape the end product of the project as well as clarify any loose ends that any member of the group had. In saying that we had drastic improvements in our workflow from Assignment 2, aspects of the group work which we still all shared could have done with a bit more work, although mostly improved on – was communication, coordination and deadlines. Although we were sharing in our shared document our progress with our allocated section, having a form of timeline or firmer deadline could have helped us keep our workflow more efficient – as many group members also had coinciding assignments due close together. This would have helped in general in order to balance all forms of work flow, which we would bring forward to any future group work.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">As a group – when evaluating our members individually, we all agreed that Matthew had adopted a leadership-type role with a determined energy – regularly helping upkeep the frequent meetings, arranging times, helping keep track of everyone’s progress through a Google Sheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13ootLdr_5ocF0zyAceXC2jbXTxvRyuhzoB5G-33JqrI/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as presented here</a> and staying heavily involved with the prototype development. This was definitely acknowledged as a big improvement on his half, given the issues faced on Assignment 2. Chalani had upkept the same energy brought forward from Assignment 2, keeping in regular communication with everyone making sure we all remained focused – reminding of deadlines, rubric requirements and overall oversight of each member’s work. Samantha had upkept her upbeat energy, regularly leading the meetings on teams – and ensuring each section had sufficient information, while making sure the workload was not too heavily dependent on a single member – such as tools and technologies which was a fairly research heavy component, HTML and prototyping. Alex regularly upkeeping his communication, attending meetings – contributing his in-depth knowledge on aspects of the report such as knowledge on API’s and Development environments, and completing work earlier than expected – with the foresight of knowing how much time his prior commitments would take up, in order to still meet deadlines. Liam had completed his work effectively, and taking a primary role with HTML – the group acknowledging his ability with attention to detail  - and helping provide clarity to the rest of the group of his original vision in order to help us shape the final product. Hayden had completed his work according to deadline, and also had taken a large role with technical aspects and support to other members such as HTML, and styling the pages to be visually appealing - and Figma
