<p style="font-size:18px"> Assignment 3 definitely had a stronger start for us. We continued discussions within days and got right back to work, balancing any other existing priorities. We had definitely improved on communication, notably having all members of our group present during every meeting – as well as present during Consultation with Anthony. We had gotten better with showing progress on our central document to show how we were progressing along with the assignment. As for points of improvement to be made for future group assignments, having slightly better communication – more in terms of content updates, perhaps having some form of progress by the time each group meeting had happened (unless explained for prior) although for the most part – we had improved on it quite a lot and got better with asking for help. An aspect which surprised me with each team member – Matthew had kept ontop of his work consistently throughout, without slipping up as he did in A2 – and more often actually took part in coordinating meeting times, Chalani had consistently kept in regular communication with all of us and reminding us of rubric requirements, Liam’s attention to detail on the project with html and the idea – keeping us informed with his original vision for the project so that the group could help make it into something more, Samantha had upkept her energy to lead group meetings as effectively as A2 and Hayden’s attention to detail with HTML as well as the Figma prototype. Throughout working on this assignment, it has only further backed how important communication was throughout the whole assignment – even if it is was only minor updates. </p>
