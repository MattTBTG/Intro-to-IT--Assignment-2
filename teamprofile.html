<p style="font-size:18px">My full name is Chalani Malindra Paranavithanage, I am currently a student at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology University (RMIT University). My student ID is: s3953977 and I am enrolled in Bachelor of Information and Technology. I am part of the THUR Assignment 2 Group #25. I was born in Sri Lanka, grew up in Italy and recently migrated to Australia. I am fluent in 4 different languages, and they are Sinhala, English, Italian and Spanish. I practice swimming and tennis whenever I get some free time to reset myself. My interest in IT started by watching my uncle working as an IT Engineer and the way how Information Technology is used to fix most of the issues we encounter in day to day life. My experience in IT is limited to basic to intermediate level. However, I have completed and obtained the European Computer Driverâ€™s Licence certificate from AICA in Italy.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Hi! My name is Samantha Sedjunggo and I am currently a student (3942916) at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT). My ethnicity is Chinese Indonesian and I can speak Indonesian, Japanese and English. I graduated high school from Our Lady of Mercy College from 2016-2021 and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. I have a passion for music as I have been playing piano since the age of 3 due to my strict stereotypical asian parents. This love for music has also grown towards a love for film as I fell in love with their scores and soundtracks and then it grew to an overall love for the experience that films create. While l have no previous experience in the field of I.T, through studying I currently have an interest in cyber security.</p>
