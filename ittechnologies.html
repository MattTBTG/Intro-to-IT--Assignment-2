<!-- CHALANI - Clouds, Services, Servers -->
<h2><u>Clouds, Services, Servers</u></h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Information Technology is rapidly evolving throughout the world to efficiently serve businesses and the society. In fact, most of these technological innovations have made our lives easier, better and faster as it aims to meet the needs and goals of the society. One of the most interesting IT developments in the recent past is the “ Cloud Computing Technology”.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">A “Cloud” in Information Technology is a platform of remote servers that are located in data centres and accessible over the internet. The “Cloud Computing Technology” is defined as a way of delivering multiple computing instances and computing services over the internet. These services comprehend storages, databases, servers, analytics, softwares, intelligence and networking. The individuals and businesses who wish to make use of these services are only required to pay for the services, the time and the capacity they utilise. According to Wei Y et al., ‘Cloud computing wraps traditional distributed computing or grid computing paradigms with a dynamically scaled business model that mitigates the risk of service overor underprovisioning for service providers by offering shared computational power that can be accessed as needed.’(Wei et al. 2010:72).</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">The benefits of cloud computing technologies are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>High Speed</strong>
      <p>It is very easy to spin up computing resources and access cloud computing services in a matter of seconds. Also, it is very flexible in terms of capacity planning without worrying much about the usual hardware limitations.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Security</strong>
      <p>Cloud offers secure storage and access to data with the use of access control procedures and role based permissions. Furthermore, cloud service providers implement authentication and encryption services to tighten up the unauthenticated access by potential intruders.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Cost</strong>
      <p>By choosing Cloud Computing infrastructures, we can reduce huge costs related to maintenance and management of costly hardware and systems used by businesses to improve their services. Also, it will help to cut down unnecessary electricity consumptions required by the equipments as well as the recruitment of expert staff in related fields.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Scalability</strong>
      <p>One of the most important features provided by cloud technologies is the ability to scale up or scale down the resource needs in a quick and efficient manner. Instead of purchasing and installing high-cost infrastructure and systems locally by ourselves, Cloud will be able to take care of these operations according to our IT requirements.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Disaster Recovery</strong>
      <p>Storing data using cloud computing is considered to be reliable in case of unpredictable disasters. As a matter of fact, Cloud makes multiple backups of stored data in different disaster recoverable sites to maintain the redundancy and minimise the downtime.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br></br>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">With the use of cloud computing, we can develop data backup solutions, file storage services, big data analytic services and software development and testing as well.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Cloud computing aims to develop and integrate few important features in the future as follows:</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AI Platforms</strong>
      <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) will be used by businesses to process big data to improve their business functions and decisions. Also, it will make workflows run smoothly by making them easy to adapt and scale according to continuously changing business needs.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>IoT Platforms</strong>
      <p>Day by day, there are millions of IoT devices connecting to cloud based IoT platforms to use cloud services. These IoT devices send and receive data over cloud IoT platforms. The high level of flexibility provided by the Cloud based IoT platforms to connect IoT devices with Cloud services such as big data analytics makes it a growing trend.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Service Mesh</strong>
      <p>Due to the complexity within Cloud platforms, the speed and the safety of the communication on cloud platforms are compromised. In order to address this issue, the communication layers will be improved to use a Service Mesh. A Service Mesh will provide a dedicated and efficient communication channel to communicate between services.</p>
    </li>

  </ul>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Furthermore, improved virtualisation, advance cloud storage and management mechanisms along with Cloud automation technologies are some of the most important technologies and developments that can support the development of the future of Cloud Technology.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">There are few potential impacts related to the development of Cloud Computing in the modern era.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">They are:</p>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Cost reduction in businesses</strong>
      <p>Most of the Cloud Computing services available in the market are based on the concept pay-as-you-go. This means that the client is benefitted by the possibility to purchase services and resources only when they need them and the payment for such services are made according to their actual usage.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Health Care</strong>
      <p>A large number of health/patient data are securely stored and managed through Cloud based portals by many healthcare institutions.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Social Media</strong>
      <p>Several well-known social media platforms make use of cloud services to host their platforms as well as to store and exchange millions of data such as photos and other multimedia related data.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Education</strong>
      <p>Nowadays, many educational institutions and students use Cloud computing services to access education materials in a matter of seconds from anywhere, at any convenient time as per their preference.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">During the covid-19 pandemic phase, Cloud services have been one of the most important technologies used by education providers to facilitate their students with required study/course materials. Additionally, it has helped teachers and lecturers to carry on with their teaching sessions without any interruptions. This convenience led millions of people to switch from in person studying to online studying with a great preference.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">According to Marston et al, ‘One of the significant opportunities of cloud computing lies in its potential to help developing countries reap the benefits of information technology without the significant upfront investments that have stymied past efforts.’ (Marston et al. 2011:176).</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">IT Engineers and IT users are the people who are equally affected by the development of Cloud computing technologies. Cloud computing services let its users to quickly access and process data they require from anywhere around the world using a reliable internet connection. Also, it provides cost effective backup solutions for their peace of mind. Meanwhile, IT Engineers will be able to easily test and deploy softwares to Cloud platforms with great scalability. Also, IT professionals such as Network Engineers, System Administrators, System Engineers tend to change their careers into the cloud industry.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">However, integration of Cloud technologies in some industries has decreased the number of in-house IT staff within businesses due to the improved usability of the Cloud platforms.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Cloud computing technologies have already made our lives easier and better through its services. In fact, it plays a vital role in our day to day activities. Few significant examples are: GPS applications which we use for navigation, stores large amounts of data on cloud platforms. These data are readily accessible by GPS application users 24/7 from anywhere across the world. Similarly, we use Cloud storage to securely store and backup our personal and business data. These stored data can be of type photos, music, software or business files with valuable and confidential information. Also, many higher education institutions offer online courses and degrees as a modern way of learning which is different from the traditional in person methods. Hence, it facilitates students, teaching staff and administrators to access course content and easily collaborate with each other through Cloud platforms without any obstacle. Equally, it saves a big amount of money on in-house infrastructures and data storage.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Overall, the usage of Cloud technology ensures the possibility  to store our data secured from potential data breaches through its advanced security features and policies as well as to scale up/down cloud capacity according to our personal and business demands. Unlike other standard IT solutions, Cloud offers the benefit to pay only for services you need and to cease payments for services you no longer require. Finally cloud computing will regularly keep up with up to date system upgrades and helps you to optimise resource utilisation to achieve your personal and business goals.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Furthermore, usage of Cloud computing helps family and friends to make their lives easier in various aspects. Using Cloud storage services, we can store and exchange documents and other data with friends and family with few mouse clicks. According to Janaki. M (2017:24), ‘Cloud can be boon for families which act as bonding agent to tie the family members logically. When the size of the family grows, it is more difficult to keep all of their activities straight. “Bigger the family, Busier the members, Harder to keep track”.’.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Without a doubt, this type of new technology has improved our ways on how we manage our basic requirements such as cloud based task schedulers, group work collaborations as well as how we communicate over cloud based  communication solutions such as Skype, Zoom and Microsoft Teams.</p>

<!-- ALEXANDER - Cybersecurity -->
<h2><u>Cybersecurity</u></h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting networks, devices and files from unauthorized or otherwise malicious attacks from the outside. The information that could be breached as a result would be a customers sensitive information, a businesses potential assets and accounts – and for regulatory practices, this can result in fines of up to $2.1 million for companies which have had serious or repeated breaches in their network (1) </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">The state of current cybersecurity measures are hard to pinpoint down to a single state, as it does vary depending if your looking at within the home or with businesses – while there’s more regulatory measures that companies would be required to meet for the bare minimum – there’s still errors that can be made. Swinburne University had a data breach in the last year from an open reservation booking webpage which was due to be closed – which leaked “5,200 Swinburne staff, 100 Swinburne students” (Spencer, L 2021) and some external contacts. The same cannot be said for home environments, where those who have use for Small file servers for regular backups and media content – more notably with the server brand QNAP, has had a recent surge in Ransomware attacks which the company still hasn’t gotten under control (Greig, J 2022). For the measures that can be taken, within the home it can even be as simple as implementing better authentication methods to protect your own information. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Using Two Factor Authentication (2FA) for websites that support it, and using authenticator key apps such as Symantec VIP or Google Authenticator – to mitigate any risk that can be had by potentially falling victim to Sim Hijacking. Using Multi-Factor Authentication, which involves another layer – which involves a security USB key such as the YubiKey (4) which plugs into your PC or can use NFC in order to be supported by mobile devices. There will only be more forms of authentication that will pop up, there is biometric devices that will ID you from how your veins in your hand as well as iris identification (Nash, J 2022), there can be a dedicated firewall that can run either through a Raspberry Pi called PFSense to help put more layers up before a person can get remotely around your network. PFSense is a community run Firewall which can help protect against outside attacks alongside other security measures, this has the added benefit of protecting against Direct Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks if you are hosting a public server.  </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Looking at measures that companies can take, as it’s a heavily regulated space – there are measures that are taking place to help with authentication issues. There are regulations being introduced, which Telstra has already put in place – to make SIM Hijacking a harder process to practice (Turner, A 2022). Telstra has introduced an SMS filter, in order to help reduce the cases of Phishing texts to help reduce the cases of identity theft or any form of monetary loss (Penn, A 2022). There are fines that have been put in place if a company doesn’t comply. The Government has put out a guide in order to help others protect their business assets (7), otherwise the measures taken can be somewhat similar to the home environment. Universities have made it part of their student login policies – to implement Two Factor Authentication in their accounts to protect their students as well as the university from any further more targeted attacks. The Current use of Virtual Private Networks (VPN) between Company and user helps to protect traffic and also another form of authentication to protect data. The Use of security keys have made Multi-Factor Authentication keys more accessible for different forms of devices rather than relying on an authentication app which most of the time needs to be reset on the account side every time its made on new devices – the regulatory developments have only been made possible because of other businesses falling victim to attacks. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">The impact of Cybersecurity is always changing, the laws and regulations definitely contribute to the lessening of instances where cyber attacks become an issue – considering companies oblige with laws, moreso if the company does have a breach but fails to report a breach to its users. There already has been law changes which requires companies to report a data breach as soon as possible, considering that there has been unauthorized access to information or a loss of information held by the company – which is likely to cause harm, and the company haven’t been able to prevent the action being taken. With tech only further progressing, the use of cybersecurity will only create jobs – as it eventually will require either a dedicated IT department in relevant companies to make maintaining their security solution cheaper than the potential fine – or will require those that build solutions, to keep security measures in mind which again can require more people. Whether the measures taken deem a new form of technology necessary, more jobs would be made to develop said solution – or updating existing solutions if the technology exists, would require a firmware update to existing devices. Or if the use of other solutions such as Windows 11’s requirement for a TPM module (Brant, T 2021), a security module which if tampered with or altered – would brick your PC – windows PC’s would not have had this strict requirement without an update to the software. So a requirement of cybersecurity itself shouldn’t be gradually deemed redundant in the near future, perhaps gradually phased out as the current solutions may become less secure – more so when a more secure solution gets released publicly</p>

<!-- HAYDEN - Machine Learning -->

<h2><u>Machine Learning</u></h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Machine Learning is a form of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that predicts an outcome through computation using data that it is trained/given with to formulate an appropriate prediction. Unlike traditional programming methods where AI instructions are directed through code, Machine Learning gathers input and then through a series of calculations based on the data given will make a decision. </p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> For example, predicting the weather tomorrow or predicting how long it will take for fruit to ripen. Computer softwares can be trained by data scientists by using already existing data, using that example, the weather of the previous days in order to generate a prediction or the previous gained data . Machine learning is currently utilised by world leading companies such as Facebook and Google to observe and evaluate customer behaviours and business development giving them an edge against many other companies that do not utilise Machine learning’s potential of making reliable predictions through data. Machine Learning’s current modern day use is not limited to just predicting trends but expands to many popular applications and softwares that we use without even noticing. Google Assistant, Siri and Amazon Alexa. What used to be rare, is now found in your everyday essential staples. All mobile phones now automatically support voice assistants, new “smart TVs” now all include a form of voice assistant. The way your famous household assistants work is also through Machine Learning, by using speech recognition to interpret our voices and provide context through the combination of two machine learning methods called supervised learning and unsupervised learning. Supervised learning requires the machine to be taught with labelled inputs while unsupervised learning does not require labelled inputs as it sorts through unlabelled data to group them together. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">The most likely development of machine learning in the next few years has already started to be started to be implemented and is presently being fine tuned and worked on. One of the world’s most known electric car brands ‘Tesla’ utilises machine learning in their autopilot advanced driver assistance feature. Tesla has used unsupervised learning in order to train the systems to be able to detect obstacles and people allowing the electric car to drive around safely. While their autopilot system only includes auto steering and traffic-awareness cruise control which matches the speed of the car to its surrounding cars, the company has also included full self-driving capabilities extending its use of machine learning within cars, taking a step in the direction of full autonomy for electric vehicles. Tesla has explicitly stated that its current system does not make the car autonomous yet but through experience and constant updates, the AI will continue to improve and become stronger.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;"> As the use of machine learning is starting to develop within this industry, the next few years could see it being fully functional in our everyday vehicles as a result of the capabilities of machine learning to be trained and improved from previous results. The reason for the promising progress on self driving cars in the recent years is due to the huge advancement of AI from 2010, where deep learning (a subset of machine learning) which involves using artificial neural networks to make intelligent decisions started seeing proper use in both speech and visual object recognition as aforementioned earlier, the integration of Siri and Google Assistant. The sudden success in the use of deep learning algorithms to help benefit our daily lives sparked the interest of many investors, students and the general public thus leading to large advancements in both machine learning and AI as a whole. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Machine learning is already having a large impact on the lives of every human both present and in the future, following with the advancement of technology, the use and ability of machine learning will only prosper and grow from that point comparable to how an individual would become better with practice over time. The current and future impacts of Machine learning includes: the use of smart home and security devices, social media browsing, transport and many more.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Linking back to the use of voice recognition in smart TV’s, the ability of voice recognition has significantly created a newer and efficient way of living through smart home living. People are finding innovative ways to improve the way they live through smart home hubs that can automate processes such as turning on the lights, setting an alarm or playing music through merely their voice. While also creating a more efficient way to live, it also creates a more safer environment through the use of surveillance systems and alarm systems by allowing Machine learning to recognise the frequent visitors of that home and detect when someone enters the house.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Smart home living can be considered the future of living, as such due to the current integration of smart home devices and its many possibilities to expand its use through AI. Another current existing use of machine learning that has created significant impact is the machine learning algorithm used for social media apps and websites. As we live in the current day and age where social media is utilised by majority of the population whether it’s for personal use or business use, what individuals see and are recommended are all done through the ability of machine learning to identify searching habits and preferences in which they then make recommendations or suggestions based on your activity on that app or website. Popular applications like YouTube and Facebook all apply this form of machine learning in it’s best possible way which has increased the overall experience and improved their lives as well. <p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">As the use of machine learning develops and expands, Machine learning will not replace jobs, but only tasks within those jobs. The ability for it to learn and act without specific code input allows it to make our lives more efficient but not to an extent where it will ruin the lives of others. This is demonstrated through the those examples mentioned prior, where they have been adapted to make life for humans much better without removing the ability of people to work. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Machine learning for us, including family and friends affect us all in a positive way with our day to day activities and our occupations both current and in future. In our daily lives machine learning has already taken ahold of some of us, personally with the use of Amazon Alexa that allows us to set alarms without buying an alarm clock, make the room light up in colours and even set up a routine that allows it to project the weather, time and update us on any type of news, upcoming events in schedules or play a specific song. It helps us become more organised and improves our lives significantly. Life would be very different without the implementation of machine learning. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;" >For some family and friends, their occupations involve being a teacher, machine learning in the education department would save them a lot of time when it comes to simple but tedious tasks, examples being:  marking assignments, seeing student attendance or calculating averages. All of these tasks which for a human being could take up alot of time doing, is done is a shorter amount of time because of the capabilities of machine learning. Therefore this would dramatically make their job much easier, as they can put their focus onto other aspects of their occupation that may make both them and their students' lives better. </p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;"> Therefore, AI and machine learning can create large impacts for both individuals, their families and friends in the way it makes our lives so much convenient, we are able to become more productive as human beings and make many more advancements as a result of increased efficiency. </p>

<!-- SAMANTHA - Autonomous Vehicles -->

<h2><u>Autonomous Vehicles</u></h2>
<p style="margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"><img src="levels.jpg" alt="levels of autonomy" height="600px" width="800px" border="1px"></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Through the vast world of technology and its rapid advancement, there are endless possibilities on how technology can aid human lives for the better, and autonomous vehicles seem to be the new goal for some. Autonomous vehicles are essentially self-driving cars that “ rely on a patchwork of hardware components, interfaces , and platforms.” (Autonomous Vehicles, 2021, pg 3). There are different levels of autonomy according to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), these levels are simplified on figure 1. Different startups and companies such as Waymo, Cruise, Tusimple and Aurora are already pursuing different vehicles that achieve multiple levels of autonomy. Like every technological advancement, autonomous vehicles have benefits and drawbacks that come with a new and avant garde project. However, the ultimate goal should be to benefit human lives for the better.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">As previously stated, there are many startups that are investing into autonomous vehicles, one of the outstanding ones is Waymo. Waymo is an American company and whose parent company is Google, they have made great progress in terms of accessibility and spreadability of autonomous vehicles as they operate “a commercial self-driving taxi service” (Wikipedia 2022, para. 1)  that already has the city of Chandler, Arizona fully mapped as well as operating in the Phoenix, Arizona area. Waymo and many others use a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDar)  system, which is a method of remote sensing that “uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to the Earth.” (Ocean Service 2021, para. 1), in simpler terms, lidar measures the time for reflected light to return to the receiver and creates a 3D image to combat driving. Whilst most companies use LiDar, other companies such as Tesla have founded their own operating system called “Tesla Vision” and it uses a “camera-based system which monitors a vehicle’s surroundings.”(Maeve Rich 2021, para. 2) and General Motors uses “a combination of cameras, radar and lidar.” (Dave LaChance 2021, para, 1).  However, none of these companies have yet to dive into full automation as of yet. In commercial use, level 2 has been achieved in vehicles such as; Tesla’s Autopilot feature, General Motors’ Chervolets’ Super Cruise feature and Nissan’s Propilot. These commercial vehicles allow owners to use these automation features for the system to control steering and acceleration, however, perception and fallback are still controlled by the drivers. Waymo has achieved level 4 of autonomy as it relies on the system to control the steering, acceleration, perception and fallback as there is no driver behind the wheel. However, Waymo still has human interaction as there is a support team who monitors these cars and is on-call for passengers to contact through a ring button in the car. Ultimately Waymo is still in test runs and is not functioning as a commercial taxi service outside of Arizona.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Within the next three years, there have already been reports of big technology companies already investing and researching autonomous vehicles. Companies such as Apple Inc., have already reported to target the year 2025 to launch its self-driving car project and it will feature an “ideal car [that] would have no steering wheel and pedals, and its interior would be designed around hands-off driving” ( Mark Gurman 2021, para. 8)which is briefly describing a level 4 autonomy. If other big companies were to invest into autonomous vehicles, society would be seeing more of a shift in everyday life as well as an increase in higher levels of autonomy. There have already been developments of everyday use of cars with level 4 autonomy, if there were also an increase in autonomous vehicles all round, levels 5 and 6 could also be reached as cars could cooperate with each other's systems coherently. However, this possibility is probably only a reality in the next decade or so due to the unenthusiastic reactions from the public in terms of autonomous vehicles used in everyday life. Ultimately the main likelihood of autonomous vehicles in the near future is more research, investment and experiments to test autonomous cars for commercial use with higher autonomy levels.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">There are benefits and drawbacks of the increased amount of  autonomous vehicles available to the public. The overwhelming benefit is safer roads,  less accidents and ultimately a decrease in deaths related to car based injuries. The National and Safety Board reported that “94% of accidents” (Derek Muller, 2021) are based on human error and the World Health Organisation identified that “approximately 1.3 million people die each year as a result of road traffic crashes” (Derek Muller, 2021). These statistics would drastically decrease if car systems were able to cooperate with each other as there would be no room for human error in these systems. As these systems are able to accumulate millions of hours of driving data that would take thousands of years for a human driver to learn, it can accurately assess a situation and calculate the correct response so all parties can survive. If these autonomous vehicles were to be more readily available to the public, passengers with physical disabilities, blind, seniors, children and many more would benefit from this system as they would be able to rely on a technical car to keep them safe without relying on others. Services like Waymo, a self-driving taxi service would be a positive effect for these people as a calculated system would assist them with travelling without the need for a licensed driver. If services like Waymo expanded and existed more prevalent across the world, jobs such as taxi drivers and mobility service providers such as Uber and DiDi drivers would no longer be needed as vehicles would be controlled by a system. Although these jobs would be made redundant, more office jobs would be available to monitor these autonomous vehicles such as Waymo’s support team available for passengers whenever they need, ultimately more white collared jobs would be created through services such as these.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">If autonomous vehicles were to become the more common mode of transportation in the future, it would affect young adults with more negatives than positives. Majority of young adults are healthy and know how to drive, autonomous vehicles would serve as more of a luxury rather than a necessity and ultimately create a more careless attitude when driving. This is because many individuals would be distracted when level 2 autonomy in vehicles as they are not actively in control of the vehicle. This can lead to distractions such as phone use, eating, talking to passengers and watching entertainment. Although level 2 autonomy allows the system to control steering and acceleration, perception and fallback are still in the hands of me as the driver, and ultimately in worst case scenarios, many are distracted due to this level of autonomy and can seriously injure drivers and fellow passengers. However, if all cars operated on systems, had higher levels of autonomy and could coordinate with each other, this would help in everyday life. If all cars on the road operated like this, there would be less chance of human error and accidents on the road, meaning less people dying due to car related accidents.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">However, individuals such as those who suffer from blindness, physical disabilities, old age, etc,  would benefit from autonomous vehicle services such as Waymo. As these individuals can heavily rely on others to provide transportation to go to appointments, grocery shopping, and other needs,  a service like Waymo would ultimately help them if either an emergency is needed to travel or if no one is available to assist them on particularly busy days.</p>
