<h2><u>Clouds, Services, Servers</u></h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Information Technology is rapidly evolving throughout the world to efficiently serve businesses and the society. In fact, most of these technological innovations have made our lives easier, better and faster as it aims to meet the needs and goals of the society. One of the most interesting IT developments in the recent past is the “ Cloud Computing Technology”.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">A “Cloud” in Information Technology is a platform of remote servers that are located in data centres and accessible over the internet. The “Cloud Computing Technology” is defined as a way of delivering multiple computing instances and computing services over the internet. These services comprehend storages, databases, servers, analytics, softwares, intelligence and networking. The individuals and businesses who wish to make use of these services are only required to pay for the services, the time and the capacity they utilise. According to Wei Y et al., ‘Cloud computing wraps traditional distributed computing or grid computing paradigms with a dynamically scaled business model that mitigates the risk of service overor underprovisioning for service providers by offering shared computational power that can be accessed as needed.’(Wei et al. 2010:72).</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">The benefits of cloud computing technologies are as follows:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>High Speed</strong>
      <p>It is very easy to spin up computing resources and access cloud computing services in a matter of seconds. Also, it is very flexible in terms of capacity planning without worrying much about the usual hardware limitations.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Security</strong>
      <p>Cloud offers secure storage and access to data with the use of access control procedures and role based permissions. Furthermore, cloud service providers implement authentication and encryption services to tighten up the unauthenticated access by potential intruders.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Cost</strong>
      <p>By choosing Cloud Computing infrastructures, we can reduce huge costs related to maintenance and management of costly hardware and systems used by businesses to improve their services. Also, it will help to cut down unnecessary electricity consumptions required by the equipments as well as the recruitment of expert staff in related fields.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Scalability</strong>
      <p>One of the most important features provided by cloud technologies is the ability to scale up or scale down the resource needs in a quick and efficient manner. Instead of purchasing and installing high-cost infrastructure and systems locally by ourselves, Cloud will be able to take care of these operations according to our IT requirements.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Disaster Recovery</strong>
      <p>Storing data using cloud computing is considered to be reliable in case of unpredictable disasters. As a matter of fact, Cloud makes multiple backups of stored data in different disaster recoverable sites to maintain the redundancy and minimise the downtime.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br></br>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">With the use of cloud computing, we can develop data backup solutions, file storage services, big data analytic services and software development and testing as well.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">Cloud computing aims to develop and integrate few important features in the future as follows:</p>

<p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>AI Platforms</strong>
      <p>AI (Artificial Intelligence) will be used by businesses to process big data to improve their business functions and decisions. Also, it will make workflows run smoothly by making them easy to adapt and scale according to continuously changing business needs.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>IoT Platforms</strong>
      <p>Day by day, there are millions of IoT devices connecting to cloud based IoT platforms to use cloud services. These IoT devices send and receive data over cloud IoT platforms. The high level of flexibility provided by the Cloud based IoT platforms to connect IoT devices with Cloud services such as big data analytics makes it a growing trend.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Service Mesh</strong>
      <p>Due to the complexity within Cloud platforms, the speed and the safety of the communication on cloud platforms are compromised. In order to address this issue, the communication layers will be improved to use a Service Mesh. A Service Mesh will provide a dedicated and efficient communication channel to communicate between services.</p>
    </li>

  </ul>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Furthermore, improved virtualisation, advance cloud storage and management mechanisms along with Cloud automation technologies are some of the most important technologies and developments that can support the development of the future of Cloud Technology.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">There are few potential impacts related to the development of Cloud Computing in the modern era.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">They are:</p>

<p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Cost reduction in businesses</strong>
      <p>Most of the Cloud Computing services available in the market are based on the concept pay-as-you-go. This means that the client is benefitted by the possibility to purchase services and resources only when they need them and the payment for such services are made according to their actual usage.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Health Care</strong>
      <p>A large number of health/patient data are securely stored and managed through Cloud based portals by many healthcare institutions.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Social Media</strong>
      <p>Several well-known social media platforms make use of cloud services to host their platforms as well as to store and exchange millions of data such as photos and other multimedia related data.</p>
    </li>

    <li><strong>Education</strong>
      <p>Nowadays, many educational institutions and students use Cloud computing services to access education materials in a matter of seconds from anywhere, at any convenient time as per their preference.</p>
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">During the covid-19 pandemic phase, Cloud services have been one of the most important technologies used by education providers to facilitate their students with required study/course materials. Additionally, it has helped teachers and lecturers to carry on with their teaching sessions without any interruptions. This convenience led millions of people to switch from in person studying to online studying with a great preference.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">According to Marston et al, ‘One of the significant opportunities of cloud computing lies in its potential to help developing countries reap the benefits of information technology without the significant upfront investments that have stymied past efforts.’ (Marston et al. 2011:176).</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">IT Engineers and IT users are the people who are equally affected by the development of Cloud computing technologies. Cloud computing services let its users to quickly access and process data they require from anywhere around the world using a reliable internet connection. Also, it provides cost effective backup solutions for their peace of mind. Meanwhile, IT Engineers will be able to easily test and deploy softwares to Cloud platforms with great scalability. Also, IT professionals such as Network Engineers, System Administrators, System Engineers tend to change their careers into the cloud industry.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">However, integration of Cloud technologies in some industries has decreased the number of in-house IT staff within businesses due to the improved usability of the Cloud platforms.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Cloud computing technologies have already made our lives easier and better through its services. In fact, it plays a vital role in our day to day activities. Few significant examples are: GPS applications which we use for navigation, stores large amounts of data on cloud platforms. These data are readily accessible by GPS application users 24/7 from anywhere across the world. Similarly, we use Cloud storage to securely store and backup our personal and business data. These stored data can be of type photos, music, software or business files with valuable and confidential information. Also, many higher education institutions offer online courses and degrees as a modern way of learning which is different from the traditional in person methods. Hence, it facilitates students, teaching staff and administrators to access course content and easily collaborate with each other through Cloud platforms without any obstacle. Equally, it saves a big amount of money on in-house infrastructures and data storage.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Overall, the usage of Cloud technology ensures the possibility  to store our data secured from potential data breaches through its advanced security features and policies as well as to scale up/down cloud capacity according to our personal and business demands. Unlike other standard IT solutions, Cloud offers the benefit to pay only for services you need and to cease payments for services you no longer require. Finally cloud computing will regularly keep up with up to date system upgrades and helps you to optimise resource utilisation to achieve your personal and business goals.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Furthermore, usage of Cloud computing helps family and friends to make their lives easier in various aspects. Using Cloud storage services, we can store and exchange documents and other data with friends and family with few mouse clicks. According to Janaki. M (2017:24), ‘Cloud can be boon for families which act as bonding agent to tie the family members logically. When the size of the family grows, it is more difficult to keep all of their activities straight. “Bigger the family, Busier the members, Harder to keep track”.’.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Without a doubt, this type of new technology has improved our ways on how we manage our basic requirements such as cloud based task schedulers, group work collaborations as well as how we communicate over cloud based  communication solutions such as Skype, Zoom and Microsoft Teams.</p>
