      <p>This meeting was attended by Chalani, Liam, Hayden and Samantha as we gave each other a brief update on our current progress with Assignment 2. By going through the Assignment 2, attendees were able to go through their current progress. Both Samantha, Hayden and Chalani began their own report on I.T Technologies and discussed it to be finalised by Wednesday 27th of April. Liam has started his questions and set to hold the interview on Wednesday 27th and finalise that portion by Friday  29th of April. Hayden has already shared the repository on Github to start the website styling and aesthetics with all the members. Chalani has nearly finished the Ideal Jobs and I.T Profile parts but she  raised the issue of member, Matthew Turner, has yet to share his Assignment 1 in order to finalise. Contact has been made to Matthew but has yet to share the document and hopefully Chalani can finish by her ideal date of Wednesday 27th of April. Alex and Matthew did not attend this meeting.</p>
